installed Windows DNS client.","A flaw in the way the installed Windows DNS client processes Link-
local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) queries can be exploited to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the NetworkService account.

Note that Windows XP and 2003 do not support LLMNR and successful
exploitation on those platforms requires local access and the ability
to run a special application. On Windows Vista, 2008, 7, and 2008 R2,
however, the issue can be exploited remotely.","Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows XP, 2003, Vista,
